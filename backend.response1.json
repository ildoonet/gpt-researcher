The plan is now to add English, Japanese and other Asian languages, including Bahasa Malaysia and Vietnamese. Kakao Brain is slated to launch KoGPT 2.0 with 30 billion parameters, targeting the third quarter of 2023.\nImage Credits: Kakao Brain\nKakao\u2019s moves are interesting, but they are not coming in a vacuum and will face a lot of established competition. Image generators are already available from OpenAI (in the form of DALL-E), Midjourney and\u00a0Stable Diffusion\u2018s Dream Studio. Just last week, Chinese tech behemoth Alibaba unveiled a generative AI-powered text-to-image model Tongyi Wanxiang for enterprise customers.\n\nSource: https://techcrunch.com/2023/07/12/kakao-ups-its-game-in-generative-ai-with-karlo-2-0-an-ai-image-generator/\nTitle: \nContent: As with the company\u2019s regionally leading messaging app KakaoTalk, the opening for a company like Kakao seems to be a leading player in AI images in its market, rather than aiming for world domination. Earlier this year, Eun-Taek Hong, chief executive officer of Kakao, said in its earnings call that the Korean tech company would offer generative AI services. But rather than competing against global peers in the field, Kakao would develop AI offerings with a focus on the Korean language (for now), Hong said.\nIt will be interesting also to see how and if Kakao builds this out in tandem with its other ambitions in AI. For example, it\u2019s making a foray into the healthcare industry. The company is developing an AI-generative offering to analyze a medical image and write a first-draft diagnosis of a patient\u2019s chest X-ray for doctors. It is also developing AI technology for drug discovery.\n\nSource: https://techcrunch.com/2023/07/12/kakao-ups-its-game-in-generative-ai-with-karlo-2-0-an-ai-image-generator/\nTitle: \nContent: Kakao\u2019s releases underscore the pressure that the company, like all incumbent tech players, has been facing to keep up with the pace of AI progress: newcomers like OpenAI, Midjourney and more have been making a huge splash and controlling the narrative on the biggest innovations of the moment. For older companies, the threat is always not just that they won\u2019t capitalize on whatever is coming next, but they\u2019ll start to look old and stale.\nTellingly Karlo 2.0 is coming just seven months after the company\u2019s previous update (1.4). Kakao Brain previously released an advanced text-to-image generator RQ-Transformer and minDALL-E on GitHub.\nThe company says Karlo 2.0 is trained on 300 million texts and images and supports a maximum resolution of 2048\u00d72048, resulting in better quality and clarity of images in various styles and sizes. This is a big advance on earlier editions of Karlo: The previous version was trained on 180 million text and image data points.\n\nSource: https://github.com/kakaobrain/honeybee\nTitle: \nContent: Disclaimer\nKakao Brain \"Honeybee\" is the name of the Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) open source project, not the customer service brand.\nAbout\nOfficial implementation of project Honeybee (CVPR 2024)\nResources\nLicense\nStars\nWatchers\nForks\nReleases\nPackages\n0\nContributors\n4\nLanguages\nFooter\nFooter navigation\n\nSource: https://techcrunch.com/2023/07/12/kakao-ups-its-game-in-generative-ai-with-karlo-2-0-an-ai-image-generator/\nTitle: \nContent: In December 2021, LG AI Research, an AI think tank unit of Korean tech firm LG, unveiled its AI-powered large language model called Exaone with capabilities of 300 billion parameters.

The mass layoffs at his companies earned him the nicknames \"Chainsaw Al\"[4] and \"Rambo in Pinstripes\", after he posed for a photo wearing an ammo belt across his chest.[5] It was later discovered that his reputed turnarounds were elaborate frauds and his career was ended after he engineered a massive accounting scandal at Sunbeam Products, now a division of Newell Brands, that forced the company into bankruptcy.[6] Dunlap is on the lists of \"Worst CEOs of All Time\" published by several business publications.[7][8] Fast Company noted that Dunlap \"might score impressively on the Corporate Psychopathy checklist\"[9][10] and in an interview, Dunlap freely admitted to possessing many of the traits of a psychopath, but considered them positive traits such as leadership and\n\nSource: https://github.com/kakaobrain/coyo-dataset\nTitle: \nContent: Navigation Menu\nSearch code, repositories, users, issues, pull requests...\nProvide feedback\nWe read every piece of feedback, and take your input very seriously.\nSaved searches\nUse saved searches to filter your results more quickly\nTo see all available qualifiers, see our documentation.\nCOYO-700M: Large-scale Image-Text Pair Dataset\nkakaobrain/coyo-dataset\nFolders and files\nLatest commit\nHistory\nassets\nassets\ndownload\ndownload\nexamples\nexamples\nsubset/COYO-Labeled-300M\nsubset/COYO-Labeled-300M\nLICENSE.cc-by-4.0\nLICENSE.cc-by-4.0\nREADME.md\nREADME.md\nRepository files navigation\n\ud83d\udc3a COYO-700M: Image-Text Pair Dataset\nCOYO-700M is a large-scale dataset that contains 747M image-text pairs as well as\nmany other meta-attributes to increase the usability to train various models.\nOur dataset follows a similar strategy to previous vision-and-language datasets,\ncollecting many informative pairs of alt-text and its associated image in HTML documents.\n\nSource: https://github.com/kakaobrain/coyo-dataset\nTitle: \nContent: If you violate the license, you may be subject to legal action such as the prohibition of use or claim for damages depending on the use.\nContact\nCOYO dataset was released as an open source in the hope that it will be helpful to many research institutes and startups for research purposes.\nWe look forward to contacting us from various places who wish to cooperate with us.\ncoyo@kakaobrain.com\nAbout\nCOYO-700M: Large-scale Image-Text Pair Dataset\nResources\nStars\nWatchers\nForks\nReleases\nPackages\n0\nContributors\n7\nLanguages\nFooter\nFooter navigation\n", "kakaobrain": "Source: https://www.kakaobrain.com/innovation/\nTitle: \nContent: Why does Kakao Brain constantly open its AI technology?

This will include an exclusive oral presentation session reserved for the most outstanding papers among accepted articles (25.33% of 8,161 submissions were accepted this year). At last year's event, only 4% of accepted papers were given time to do an oral presentation in which Kakao Brain was nominated for its exceptional research paper, 'HOTR: End-to-End Human-Object Interaction Detection with Transformers.' This year, not only has 'Smooth-Swap' managed to significantly reduce the complexity of its architecture, it also possesses great potential for commercialization, both of which have been recognized and rewarded by the premier computer vision conference.\n\nSource: https://huggingface.co/blog/vit-align\nTitle: \nContent: Performance Comparison\nKakao Brain's released ViT and ALIGN models perform on par and sometimes better than what Google has reported about their implementation. Kakao Brain's ALIGN-B7-Base model, while trained on a much fewer pairs (700 million pairs vs 1.8 billion), performs on par with Google's ALIGN-B7-Base on the Image KNN classification task and better on MS-COCO retrieval image-to-text, text-to-image tasks. Kakao Brain's ViT-L/16 performs similarly to Google's ViT-L/16 when evaluated on ImageNet and ImageNet-ReaL at model resolutions 384 and 512. This means the community can use Kakao Brain's ViT and ALIGN models to replicate Google's ViT and ALIGN releases especially when users require access to the training data. We are excited to see open-source and transparent releases of these model that perform on par with the state of the art!\nCOYO DATASET\n\nSource: https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/kakao-brain-brings-big-improvements-to-the-metaverse-with-new-face-swap-technology-301541582.html\nTitle: \nContent: The simple architecture and enhanced performance of 'Smooth-Swap' have not only made the technology competitive in terms of its commercialization potential and wider application, they also allow it to face more challenging face-swapping scenarios such as face swapping during video playback. 'Smooth-Swap' suggests a differentiated identity embedding approach and empowers the generator to create higher-quality images, especially when changing a subject's face shape. Through Kakao Brain's 'Smooth-Swap,' which enables fast and stable face swapping, it is expected to develop various kinds of digital humans such as virtual influencers, show hosts, and announcers.\n"}}
